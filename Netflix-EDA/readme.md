# Netflix Data Exploration 
## Overview
This project show cases how I analysed and explored Netflix Data to uncover insights about the platform's content, how the content has been released over the years, genre distribution, country of origin and content ratings. The goal of the analysis was to get an understanding of the data, clean the data, perform visualisations and create a summary of the findings.
